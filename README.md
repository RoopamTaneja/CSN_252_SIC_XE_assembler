# SIC-XE-Assembler

SIC-XE-Assembler written in C++ supporting Program Blocks for CSN-252 System Software course.

## Instructions

```bash
git clone git@github.com:RoopamTaneja/CSN_252_SIC_XE_assembler.git
cd CSN_252_SIC_XE_assembler
g++ .\src\pass2.cpp -o .\testing\assembler
```

Now copy the assembly code you wish to assemble in `assembly_code.txt` file of `testing` folder. Some sample assembly codes have been provided in `sample` folder.

```bash
cd testing
.\assembler.exe
```

All output and intermediate files are generated in the same folder.

## Code

The source code can be found at `src` folder. 

`src/helper_functions.cpp` contains frequently used helper functions.

`src/table_structures.cpp` contains various tables and structs used throughout the code.

`src/pass1.cpp` generates Symbol Table, Intermediate File for the pass2 and also generates Error File.

`src/pass2.cpp` works on the Intermediate File generated by pass1 and generates Listing File and Object Program File.

## Sample programs

Sample programs can be found in `sample` directory.
